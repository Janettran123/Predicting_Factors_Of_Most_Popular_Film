# Predicting_Factors_Of_Most_Popular_Film
This project uses logistic regression (poisson) to identify what factors make a film successful 


Overall, being able to identify what makes a movie popular allows filmmakers to create content that not only entertains but also connects with audiences on a deeper level, leading to greater impact and success. Movies play a vital role in society, shaping culture, influencing perceptions, and enriching lives in various ways. They have the power to entertain, educate, inspire, and connect people across different backgrounds and experiences.
